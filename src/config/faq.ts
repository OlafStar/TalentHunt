        question: 'Why should I use your service?',
        answer: "Good question, but let's see the figures. We are cheaper than hiring one HR employee. Also, sometimes you don't have enough work to fill a full employee calendar, but here you can pause or cancel your subscription at any time so you don't burn your money.",
    },
    {
        question: 'How does the pause feature work?',
        answer: 'We understand that sometimes the recruitment process may take less than a month or we may find talent for you 10 days before your subscription ends. There is time to pause and the days left in your current subscription will be saved for future use.',
    },
    {
        question: 'How can I create a request?',
        answer: 'You can create a request by writing or recording a brief and attach to our Trello dashboard. We are flexible, so we can also just give you a call.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What if Iâ€™m not satisfied with provided candidates?',
        answer: "Don't worry, we'll keep working until you hire the best candidate.",
    },
    {
        question: 'What is your specialization?',
        answer: 'We specialise in IT, which is where we have the most experience, but we offer a recruitment process for all niches.',
    },
    {
        question: 'You mentioned technical interviews for IT',
        answer: 'Yes! In our recruitment process, we also offer a technical check of the software developers before we deliver them to your company. This process is carried out by experienced partner developers.',
    },
    {
        question: "Are there any refunds if I don't like the service?",
        answer: 'Due to the high quality nature of the work, there will be no refunds issued.',
    },
